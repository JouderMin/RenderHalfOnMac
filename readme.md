# Render Half On Mac

A little tool mod inspired by [rubidium-extra](https://github.com/dima-dencep/rubidium-extra).

This mod currently only supports Minecraft 1.20.1 with Forge mod loader. It may support more Minecraft version in the
future.

By the way, you need to make sure that you disable forge load screen in config, otherwise it may cause some weird stuff.
Just put this in ``config/fml.toml``

``` toml
earlyWindowControl = false
```
